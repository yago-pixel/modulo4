# My JavaScript Code Quiz

## Description
Welcome to my JavaScript Code Quiz. This Quiz will test your basic knowledge on JavaScript. It is a timed quiz, on which you can get a score, 
the more questions you answer right, the higher you score will be, obviously! The development of this app deepened my knowledge in using Web APIs,
but also the combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS in one application.
Have fun testing you knowledge in JavaScript!

Here is a link to the Code Quiz: [Link to Code Quiz](https://yago-pixel.github.io/my-javascript-code-quiz/)

## Usage
To start the Quiz, you can simply press the "Start quiz"-button:

![start-quiz]

On the top right, you will see a timer of 75 seconds starting - This is the time you will have to answer all the questions.

![timer]


On the top left, you can see a link to the view high scores page, which will allow you to see your saved highscores. (the go back button will just redirect you to the starting page, so I would not recommend going on the highscores page, while completing the quiz)

![view-high-scores]


First, you are presented with the first question and four answer possibilities. All questions follow the same scheme.

![question-and-answers]

If you click on one of the answers you are directed to the next question and under the answer you will see, if you answered "Correct!" or "Wrong!".

![correct]

![wrong]

Warning! Each time you answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds of the timer will be deducted, which is also your score.

After you answered all the questions, you see a form and your final score. 

![initials-and-score]

You can submit your initials and will land on the highscore page, which will show a list of your saved scores and your Initials next to them.

![highscores]

You have two options, to either go back to the starting page or clear your score and go back after.

![go-back]

Enjoy!
